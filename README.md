# Workshop: Dapr for Building Distributed .NET Applications
Level: Intermediate

Modern distributed applications require much more than just application logic. Features such as state management for services, communication using publish/subscribe messaging and event-driven binding to cloud resources might be needed. Dapr introduces a runtime to offer such building blocks, and is less invasive in your application, allowing you to pick and choose what you need. In this workshop, we will look at the approach that the Dapr runtime takes with a sidecar architecture, separating application logic from the Dapr runtime components. You learn to develop distributed applications in .NET using Dapr's features and, how to bind to messaging infrastructure and cloud resources.

You will learn:
- Making life of cloud developers easier
- Learn about what Dapr can do for you as a developer
- Make distributed applications easier

## Dapr Fundamentals GloboTicket Demo Application
For this workshop we are using an application called GloboTicket that is here in this repository.
